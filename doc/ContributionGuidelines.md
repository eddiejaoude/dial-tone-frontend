# Contributions

* We are using GitFlow https://github.com/nvie/gitflow
* Every commit (inc. code / documentation etc) must go through a Pull Request
* Before merging a Pull Request, in addition to reviewing the code, check the following:
    * Build status
    * Static Code Analysis
    * Code Coverage
    * Documentation
* When merging a Pull Request `Squash` the **Commits** with the **Feature** Description - this is used for the **Changelog**  
    * Do not delete branches once merge as they will contain the **commit history**
